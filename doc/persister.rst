Implementing a custom persister
===============================

The bundle assumes that you're using Doctrine to store your user entity. If you're using something else, e.g. your user
entity is managed by an API, you have to implement a custom persister service.

The persister has to implement ``Scheb\TwoFactorBundle\Model\PersisterInterface``.

As an example see the ``Scheb\TwoFactorBundle\Model\Persister\DoctrinePersister``, which is provided by the bundle.

Register it as a service and configure the service name:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # config/packages/scheb_2fa.yaml
   scheb_two_factor:
       persister: acme.custom_persister
