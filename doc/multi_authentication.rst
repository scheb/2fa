Multiple Activated Authentication Methods
=========================================

A user can have multiple authentication methods enabled at the same time. You can choose if you want to have:

* a multi-level authentication process (three-factor and even more)
* or two-factor authentication and give the user the possibility to choose the authentication method

You can set the in the firewall configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # config/packages/security.yaml
   security:
       firewalls:
           your_firewall_name:
               two_factor:
                   multi_factor: false  # If ALL active two-factor methods need to be fulfilled

If you're not using multi-factor authentication, the user might want to configure a default two-factor method, which is
requested first, before switching to another two-factor method. You can provide the preferred two-factor method by
implementing the ``Scheb\TwoFactorBundle\Model\PreferredProviderInterface`` interface in the user entity. Return the
alias of the two-factor provider, for example ``google`` or ``email`` for the ones shipped with this bundle. If ``null``
is returned the default order is applied.
