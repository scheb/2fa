The Authentication Process with Two-Factor Authentication
---------------------------------------------------------

**What changes when you add two-factor authentication to your application?**

The bundle hooks into the security layer and listens for authentication events. When a user login appears and the user has
two-factor authentication enabled, access and privileges are temporarily withheld, putting the authentication status
into an intermediate state. The user is challenged to enter a valid two-factor authentication code. Only when that code
is entered correctly, the associated roles are granted.

To represent the state between login and a valid two-factor code being entered, the bundle introduces the role-like
attribute ``IS_AUTHENTICATED_2FA_IN_PROGRESS``, which can be used in ``is_granted()`` calls. ``IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY``
is – just like roles – withheld until the two-factor authentication step has been completed successfully.
