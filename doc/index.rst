Two-Factor Authentication Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bundle supports the following authentication methods out of the box:

* :doc:`Google Authenticator </providers/google>`
* :doc:`TOTP Authenticator </providers/totp>`
* :doc:`Code-via-Email authentication </providers/email>`

**3rd-party packages:**

.. note::

    There are 3rd-party packages for adding different two-factor authentication methods. Check out the
    `related packages on Packagist.org <https://packagist.org/packages/scheb/2fa-bundle/dependents>`_.

* `Webauthn via jbtronics/2fa-webauthn <https://github.com/jbtronics/2fa-webauthn>`_

The Authentication Process with Two-Factor Authentication
---------------------------------------------------------

**What changes when you add two-factor authentication to your application?**

The bundle hooks into the security layer and listens for authentication events. When a user login appears and the user has
two-factor authentication enabled, access and privileges are temporarily withheld, putting the authentication status
into an intermediate state. The user is challenged to enter a valid two-factor authentication code. Only when that code
is entered correctly, the associated roles are granted.

   :alt: Authentication process

To represent the state between login and a valid two-factor code being entered, the bundle introduces the role-like
attribute ``IS_AUTHENTICATED_2FA_IN_PROGRESS``, which can be used in ``is_granted()`` calls. ``IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY``
is – just like roles – withheld until the two-factor authentication step has been completed successfully.
