Brute Force Protection
======================

Brute force protection is essential for two-factor authentication, because otherwise the authentication code could just
be guessed by an attacker. The bundle doesn't come with a predefined anti brute force solution, but you can easily
implement one by listening to the :doc:`events </events>` provided by the bundle.

1) Log failed two-factor attempts
---------------------------------

Register a listener for the ``scheb_two_factor.authentication.failure`` event. Log whatever you need (IP, user, etc.)
to detect brute force attacks.

2) Block authentication
-----------------------

Register a listener for the ``scheb_two_factor.authentication.attempt`` event. Execute your brute-force detection logic
and decide if the attempt should be blocked. Since that event is dispatched directly before the two-factor code is
checked, you can prevent that from happening by throwing a new exception of type
``Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Exception\AuthenticationException``. That exception will be caught by the
authentication layer and the exception message is shown to the user.
