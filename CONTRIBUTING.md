Creating a Pull Request
-----------------------

You're welcome to [contribute](https://github.com/scheb/2fa/graphs/contributors) new features by creating
a pull requests or feature request in the issues section. Besides new features,
[translations](src/bundle/Resources/translations) are highly welcome.

For pull requests, please follow these guidelines:

- Symfony code style (use `php_cs.xml` to configure the code style in your IDE)
- PHP7.1 type hints for everything (including: return types, `void`, nullable types)
- `declare(strict_types=1)` must be used
- Please add/update test cases
- Test methods should be named `[method]_[scenario]_[expected result]`

### Running Quality Checks

Before you create a pull request, please make sure your changes fulfill the quality criteria:

1) Install the dependencies with `composer install`
2) Run the PHPUnit tests with `vendor/bin/phpunit`
3) Run PHP CodeSniffer with `vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=php_cs.xml --ignore=/vendor/ .`
