ℹ️ The repository contains bundle versions ≥ 5, which are compatible with Symfony 4.4 or later. The older (unsupported)

---

The bundle is split into sub-packages, so you can choose the exact feature set you need and keep installed dependencies
to a minimum.

Core features are provided by `scheb/2fa-bundle`:

- Interface for custom two-factor authentication methods
- Trusted IPs
- Multi-factor authentication (more than 2 steps)
- CSRF protection
- Whitelisted routes (accessible during two-factor authentication)
- Fully customizable conditions when to perform two-factor authentication
- Future proof: Supports the [authenticator-based security system](https://symfony.com/doc/current/security/experimental_authenticators.html),
  which will replace the current system in Symfony 6

Additional features:

- Trusted devices (once passed, no more two-factor authentication on that device) (`scheb/2fa-trusted-device`)
- Single-use backup codes for when you don't have access to the second factor device (`scheb/2fa-backup-code`)
- QR codes to scan with your mobile device (`scheb/2fa-qr-code`)

Two-factor authentication methods:

- [TOTP authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm) (`scheb/2fa-totp`)
- [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator) (`scheb/2fa-google-authenticator`)
- Authentication code via email (`scheb/2fa-email`)
